# Getting Started

## Requirements

* See the [Laravel server requirements](https://laravel.com/docs/5.7/installation#server-requirements).
* Laravel Enso uses the `json` data type.
    * If using MySQL, [a minimum version of 5.7.8 is required](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/json.html).
    * If using MariaDB, [a minimum version of 10.2.7 is required](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/library/json-data-type).

## Installation Steps

1. Download the project with `git clone https://github.com/laravel-enso/Enso.git`

2. Run in the project folder `composer install`

3. Create a database for your site (see the [Laravel database documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/5.7/database)), copy or rename the `.env.example` file to `.env`, edit the database configuration information, and run `php artisan key:generate`

4. Run `php artisan migrate --seed`

5. Launch the site (see the Local Development Server section of the [Laravel installation documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/5.7/#installation)) and log into the project with user: `admin@laravel-enso.com`, password: `password`

6. Install node dependencies`yarn`

7. Compile `yarn dev` / `yarn hot`

### Optional

8. Setup the configuration files as needed in `config/enso/*.php`

Enjoy!

## Docker
   Laravel Enso comes with a simple docker environment to help with development. By default it has two containers,
   the enso container and the enso-mysql container. There is also a optional phpmyadmin container that can be used by removing the commentented
   lines in docker-compose.yml.

   #### Containers

   - The enso container run's the apache webserver and has yarn & composer installed.
   - The enso-mysql container handle's the database the default user is `root` with a blank password and the default database is `enso`
   - The enso-phpmyadmin container is optional and attaches a phpMyAdmin instance the the enso-mysql database.

   #### Steps to use

   - Rename .env.example to .env and fill out the appropriate variables.
   - Run `docker-compose up` to start the containers. To daemonize the process
     run `docker-compose up --build -d`.
   - Enter into the enso container to begin the enso installation with `docker exec -it enso bash`
   - Install laravel enso following the [guide](https://docs.laravel-enso.com/guide/getting-started.html).

### Known issues

* When you run `php artisan migrate --seed`, you may hit an error in the form `SQLSTATE[42000]: Syntax error or access violation: 1071 Specified key was too long; max key length is 767 bytes`. If so:
    * See [this post](https://laravel-news.com/laravel-5-4-key-too-long-error) for details on how to address the error.
    * After addressing the error, drop all tables from your site database (or delete and recreate the database), then run `php artisan migrate --seed` again.
